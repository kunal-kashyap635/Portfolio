Hi, I'm Kunal — a full-stack developer, web architect, and AI/ML engineer with a passion for building scalable, secure, and user-friendly applications. From crafting intuitive React Native mobile experiences to architecting robust backend systems with PHP and Python, I thrive on solving complex problems and delivering polished solutions.

As a web developer, I specialize in building dynamic, high-performance applications using modern frameworks like Next.js and integrating APIs to create seamless user experiences. My work spans frontend finesse, backend logic, and everything in between.

On the AI/ML front, I explore conversational AI, model integration with Hugging Face and LangChain, and intelligent automation. Whether it's refining NLP pipelines or debugging GenAI workflows, I enjoy pushing boundaries to make machines smarter and more useful.

This portfolio showcases my journey across mobile, web, and intelligent systems — blending creativity with precision to build tech that matters.
